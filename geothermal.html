            <div id="navGeo">
                <p>Geothermal energy is another way to use green energy in the home. Geothermal heat pumps work as both heaters and coolers in your house. Unlike regular temperature systems, geothermal heat pumps use the mostly constant temperature of the earth, and, in some cases, water, instead of the air outside to heat or cool your home.</p>

            <div id="headerBannerGeo">
                <p>Homes situated in climates that affect the soil may want to have different types, lengths, and axes of geothermal heat pumps. For example, homes situated in rocky, shallow soil may want to install a vertical heating system instead of other ground loops. Homes with a large area of land may want to install a horizontal ground loop, and homes with minimal space are recommended to install a vertical one. </p>
                <br>

                <div id="sidebarGeo">
                    <p>Geothermal heat pumps can either use the group heat or water as their exchange mediums. The former includes horizontal and vertical systems. Horizontal heating systems are the most cost-effective system for a residential home, costing around $15,000 for basic models and upwards to $34,000 for high-end systems. Vertical geothermal heat pumps are mostly used for commercial buildings because they don’t take up as much space as vertical systems do. Vertical systems are priced between $20,000-$38,000.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Both pond/lake and open-loop systems can only be effective if you live near a decently sized body of water. Although pond/lake systems are self-explanatory, open-loop systems generate heat using water from a well or surface water that circulates through the system. The water is then returned to the well or surface body water. Both systems are the most cost effective for those living next to water, the average price at $10,000 to $30,000.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These heat systems still need maintenance and routine checks even if they're underground, protected by the elements. Yearly or seasonal checks for geothermal heat pumps are encouraged. If problems go unchecked for long periods of time, repair costs can rack up to $150-1500, or, in some cases, more if components need replacement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Inflation Reduction Act offers a tax credit available for the 2023-2032 tax years that covers up to 30% of the cost of geothermal heat pumps. With Florida’s Property Tax Abatement for Renewable Energy Property incentive, homeowners are fully exempt from property tax on geothermal heat pumps. Any increase to your property’s value following the installation of a geothermal heat pump will not be reflected in your property taxes.</p>
