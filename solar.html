            <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>

            <p>Solar panels are one of the most popular ways to implement solar energy in a home due to their energy savings and the 
                increase in property value. Solar Panels convert sunlight into electrical energy that can be immediately used to power 
                houses. It can also be put  into  batteries for storage. Solar panels generally last for 25 years before signs of 
                inefficient energy production start to show.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Solar panels are generally suitable for most homes and climates, but there are some restrictions. 
                Houses with aged rooftops, heavy tree cover, and those located in frequently cold, dark, and 
                cloudy areas can decrease the amount of sunlight the solar panels receive and are not recommended.</p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Although solar panels are a popular choice and one that is cost is going down every year, their average 
                cost is between $15,000 and $20,000 per home. Even with the 30% tax credit, you are still paying $10,000+ 
                on average, and these costs can stack up with the more solar panels installed.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>To upkeep solar panels, some homeowners buy warranties covering parts of maintenance costs, 
                but annually, solar panel care can cost around $200. Cleanings and inspections can each cost $150. 
                The Inflation Reductions Act of 2023 provides a 30% tax credit for the PV system, an electrical system 
                using solar, wind, or other renewable energy sources. This credit will drop to cover 26% of appliances in 
                2033, 22% in 2034, then gone completely in 2035 if itâ€™s not renewed.</p>
            <h3>Solar Water Heaters</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "content45">
            <p>Like all solar energy systems, solar heaters utilize the sun to heat water and are not recommended for areas
                 that get little direct sunlight. Flat-plate collectors, integral collector-storage systems, and evacuated-tube 
                 solar collectors both collect solar energy. Solar thermal collectors heat fluid inside a heater that is then 
                 pumped in active systems, or moved by natural convection in passive systems, into a hot water tank where the heat is stored. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Like all solar energy systems, solar powered water heaters carry a hefty price tag. The average cost of an 80 gallon water
                 tank is around $6,500, not counting the solar collector price. The commonly used flat-plate solar collector is usually 
                 priced around $100 per square foot (ex: standard 4x10 solar collector would be around $4,000). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Solar water heaters can severely cut down on water heating costs. The US Department of Energy states that the average annual
                 price of water heating for American homes is $400-$600 a year. With the use of a solar water heater, annual prices of water 
                 heating will drop to around $200-$300, an almost 50% decrease from what you were paying before. Although there is a significant 
                 cost decrease, periodic maintenance for solar water heaters is around $400, not including occasional parts replacements.
