                        <p>Solar panels are one of the most popular ways to implement solar energy in one’s home due to their energy-saving capabilities and the increase in property value when installed. Solar Panels convert sunlight into electrical energy that can be immediately used to power your house. This energy can also be put into batteries for storage. Solar panels generally last up to 25 years before signs of inefficient energy production start to show.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The average cost of solar panels is between $15,000 and $20,000 per home. Even with the 30% tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act, homeowners can expect to pay $10,000 or more on average, and these costs can stack up with more solar panels installed.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To upkeep solar panels, some homeowners buy warranties covering parts of maintenance costs, but annually, solar panel care can cost around $200. Cleanings and inspections generally cost $150 each. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Inflation Reduction Act offers a tax credit available for the 2023-2032 tax years that covers up to 30% of the cost of solar electricity. With Florida’s Property Tax Abatement for Renewable Energy Property incentive, homeowners are fully exempt from property tax on residential solar equipment. This means your property taxes won’t go up after installing solar energy sources on your property.</p>

                        <p>Solar panels are generally suitable for most homes and climates, but there are some restrictions. Houses with aged rooftops, heavy tree cover, and those located in frequently cold, dark, and cloudy areas can decrease the amount of sunlight the solar panels receive and aren't recommended.

                        <p>Like all solar energy systems, solar heaters utilize the sun to heat water. Flat-plate collectors, integral collector-storage systems, and evacuated-tube solar collectors all provide solar energy for the water tank. Solar thermal collectors heat fluid inside a heater that is then pumped into active systems or moved by natural convection in passive systems into a hot water tank where the heat is stored.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Solar powered water heaters carry a hefty price tag. The average cost of an 80 gallon water tank is around $6,500, excluding the price of the solar collector. The commonly used flat-plate solar collector usually costs around $100 per square foot (ex: standard 4x10 solar collector would be around $4,000). With the Inflation Reduction Act, the price drops to about $4,500.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Inflation Reduction Act offers a tax credit available for the 2023-2032 tax years that covers up to 30% of the cost of solar water heaters. With Florida’s Property Tax Abatement for Renewable Energy Property incentive, homeowners are fully exempt from property tax on residential solar equipment. This means your property taxes won’t go up after installing solar energy sources on your property.</p>

                        <p>Solar water heaters can severely cut down on water heating costs. The US Department of Energy states that the average annual price of water heating in American homes is $400-$600 a year. With the use of a solar water heater, annual prices of water heating will drop to around $200-$300–an almost 50% decrease from what you were paying before. Although there is a significant cost decrease, periodic maintenance for solar water heaters is around $400, not including occasional parts replacements.
