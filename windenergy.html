            <h2>Residential Wind Turbines</h2>

            <p>Renewable energy from wind generating sources are also suitable for residential use. Though, installing wind-energy generators are not as accessible or suitable for everyone as, say, solar panels. homes in rough terrains and leeward areas are not recommended to use wind energy as it is not effective or cost-saving. Those situated in areas with 10 mph or more are eligible to install a residential turbine if other parameters such as size, space, and location are met.

            <p>	Roof mounted wind turbines are the most common for residential use. Houses with high roofs and experience strong winds are recommended to install a roof mounted wind turbine. These can generate 0.5KW-2.5KW of power and are not able to generate enough energy to supply a standard household. These small turbines cost around $3,000-5,000 for every kilowattâ€“systems generating 2KW of power are estimated to cost around $10,000.

            <br>
            <p>You can also use wind energy to reduce consumption of utility supplied electricity with grid-connected small wind electric systems. These wind electric systems are connected to the electricity distribution systems. If the energy they produce covers more electricity households require, the excess is stored and used to offset utility-supplied power in the future. These systems also work during power outages and work with storage to provide back-up power. To meet the grid-connection requirements, contact your power provider directly or state utilities commission, state utility consumer advocate group, state consumer representation office, or state energy office. These systems can also expect to cost around $5,000 a kilowatt produced and can cost upwards of $75,000. Homeowners living in areas with 10mph+ wind speeds and suitable grid connection are eligible for installing a grid-connected small wind electric system.
